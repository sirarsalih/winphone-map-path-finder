<h1>winphone-map-path-finder</h1>

A Windows Phone 8 map path finder application. The application receives plotted points on the map from the user, then sends a GET request to <a href="https://github.com/sirar87/azure-cloud-service-ga/" target="_blank">this Azure back-end</a> which then responds with the shortest path between the points.
